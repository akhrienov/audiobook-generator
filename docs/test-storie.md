## SCENE:HOOK

[AMBIENT] gentle crackling of fire, distant wind

[NAR] The invitations arrived on a Tuesday. Hand-delivered to five specific homes in Willow Creek. Each sealed with red wax bearing the impression of a horseshoe. Each containing the same message written in Samuel Thorne's jagged scrawl.

[SFX] paper unfolding

[SAM|deliberate] Your presence is requested for supper at Thorne Stables. Saturday. Sunset. Come hungry.

[NAR] They all accepted, of course. In a town as small as Willow Creek, one didn't decline an invitation—especially not from Samuel Thorne. Not since what happened to Margaret. Not since she disappeared.

[SFX] multiple footsteps approaching, door opening

[SAM|warm+tense] Welcome, gentlemen! Please, come in from the cold. The table is set, the fire is high, and the meat... well, the meat is the finest you'll ever taste.

[THO|jovial] Smells like heaven itself, Sam! What beast yielded such a feast?

[SAM|dark] One that wandered where it shouldn't have, Thomas. One that wandered where it shouldn't have.

[SFX] door closing firmly, lock turning

## SCENE:SETUP

[NAR] Samuel Thorne's home sat behind his stables, a stone structure with thick walls that kept secrets well. Inside, a long oak table dominated the main room, set with his finest pewter and six mismatched chairs. The men of Willow Creek filed in, stomping snow from their boots, their breath visible in the cold air before the heat of the fire reached them.

[SFX] boots stomping, men greeting each other, chairs scraping

[THO|boisterous] By God, Samuel, it's been months since you've had company! Not since—

[SFX] awkward throat clearing

[SAM|cutting] Not since Margaret left, yes.

[SAM|forced] But tonight isn't about the past. It's about sharing something special with my... dearest friends.

[WIL|smooth] Your home looks well-kept, Samuel. I'd have thought a man alone might let things slide.

[SAM|edge] Some things require meticulous attention, William. Like preparing the perfect meal. Or remembering who visits your home when you're tending the horses.

[SFX] uncomfortable shifting in chairs

[HEN|nervous] Is there, ah, an occasion for this gathering, Samuel? Harvest was weeks ago, and Christmas is still a month away.

[SAM|smiling] The occasion is discovery, Henry. And celebration. I've made some... interesting discoveries lately.

[MIC|eager] About horses, sir? Everyone says you've a gift with them.

[SAM|amused] Not horses this time, boy. Though I do understand animals. Their instincts. Their betrayals.

[SFX] liquid pouring into cups

[ROB|mumbling] Strong ale you've brewed.

[SAM|ominous] Drink deep, friends. Tonight calls for courage. And now, the meal I promised you.

[SFX] heavy platter being set down

[NAR] Samuel disappeared into the kitchen and returned with a large covered platter. Steam escaped as he lifted the lid, revealing meat so tender it seemed to fall apart at the mere proximity of the serving knife. The aroma filled the room—rich, complex, unlike any game they'd tasted before. Each man leaned forward unconsciously, drawn by a primal hunger.

[SAM|proud] Eat, gentlemen. Tell me how it tastes.

## SCENE:FEAST

[SFX] utensils on plates, appreciative murmurs

[THO|full] This is extraordinary, Samuel! What manner of beast provides such tender flesh?

[SAM|evasive] Something rare. Something that... knew this town well.

[WIL|analytical] Fascinating complexity. Reminds me of veal, yet... different. Sweeter somehow.

[SAM|watching] Sweet, yes. That's fitting.

[HEN|nervous] You hunted this yourself, Samuel?

[SAM|dark] No hunting required, Henry. It came to me. As things often do when no one's watching.

[ROB|slow] Peculiar flavor.

[MIC|enthusiastic] I've never tasted anything like it, sir! Will you share the preparation?

[SAM|smiling] All in good time, Michael. All in good time. First, eat. Enjoy. I want everyone to have their fill before we discuss... ingredients.

[NAR] The men ate heartily, passing the platter around for second helpings. Only Samuel ate sparingly, his eyes moving from face to face, studying their expressions with unsettling intensity. Outside, the wind picked up, rattling the shutters like fingers asking to be let in.

[SFX] wind growing stronger, shutters rattling

[SAM|raising] A toast, gentlemen. To appetites. And to Margaret.

[SFX] uncomfortable silence

[THO|clearing] Samuel, perhaps it's best not to—

[SAM|hard] To Margaret. My wife. Who you all knew so... intimately.

[SFX] glasses being set down

[WIL|cautious] Samuel, we understand your grief, but it's been six months. The search parties found nothing. Sometimes people just—

[SAM|cutting] Disappear? Is that what you were going to say, William? People don't just disappear. They go somewhere. Or they become something else.

## SCENE:SUSPICION

[NAR] The mood shifted like a weather vane in a storm. The rich food that had seemed so appetizing now sat heavily in their stomachs. Samuel rose and walked to the fireplace, his back to his guests, shoulders tense beneath his rough woolen shirt.

[SAM|INTERNAL] They're starting to understand. I can feel it in the air. Soon they'll know what they've consumed. What I've done.

[THO|cautious] You said you had discoveries to share, Samuel?

[SAM|cold] I've been thinking about loyalty, Thomas. The loyalty of men. The loyalty of wives. Margaret was not loyal.

[HEN|nervous] Samuel, perhaps we should—

[SAM|sharp] Perhaps you should listen, Henry. Since you were so eager to listen to Margaret's whispers behind the mill last spring.

[SFX] chair scraping as Henry shifts uncomfortably

[HEN|stammering] I—I don't know what you—

[SAM|cold] Don't lie at my table, Henry. Not when you've eaten my food. Not when you've tasted—

[WIL|diplomatic] Samuel, we're all friends here. Whatever grievances you believe you have—

[SAM|bitter] Friends? Is that what friends do, William? Visit a man's wife when he's tending horses for the town? Leave muddy boots under her bed that don't belong to her husband?

[SFX] tense silence

[MIC|confused] Sir, I don't understand what—

[ROB|urgent] Quiet, boy.

[SAM|warm+unsettling] More meat, gentlemen? There's plenty. I made sure there would be enough for everyone.

[SFX] scraping of serving spoon on platter

[THO|uneasy] I'm quite satisfied, thank you.

[SAM|insistent] But you must have more. It's a special recipe. One I created just for this gathering.

## SCENE:FLASHBACK

[SFX] wind howling, fire crackling

[NAR] As the night deepened, Samuel began to speak of Margaret. His voice shifted between tenderness and rage, love and hatred, as he recounted their life together. The men sat motionless, ale forgotten, the remains of their meal congealing on their plates.

[SAM|soft] She had a way of walking. Like she was always dancing to music only she could hear.

[SFX] faint, distant humming of a woman

[SAM|harder] But she danced for others too, didn't she?

[NAR] Samuel's eyes locked on Thomas, who shifted uncomfortably in his seat.

[SAM|accusatory] You were first, weren't you, Thomas? While I repaired the smithy's roof. Did you think I wouldn't notice her scent on you when you paid me?

[SAM|relentless] Henry behind the mill. Robert in the granary. Even you, Michael. Barely a man, but man enough for her, apparently.

[MIC|horrified] No! I never—

[SAM|angry] LIES!

[SFX] fist slamming on table, plates jumping, liquid spilling

[SAM|calm] I confronted her, of course. Three weeks ago. Told her I knew everything. Every man. Every betrayal.

[TRANSITION] echo effect begins

[MAR|desperate] Samuel, please! It wasn't what you think!

[SAM|fury] I saw you, Margaret. With all of them. Every. Single. One.

[MAR|sobbing] I'll leave! I'll go away and never return. Just let me go, Samuel!

[SAM|breaking] How can I let you go when you're the only thing I've ever loved?

[SFX] struggle, scream cut short

[TRANSITION] echo effect ends

[SAM|calm] She didn't suffer. I made sure of that. Quick. Clean. Like butchering a lamb.

[SFX] gasps around the table

## SCENE:REVELATION

[WIL|horrified] My God, Samuel. What have you done?

[SAM|smiling] God has nothing to do with this, William. This is between us. Between men who broke bread together. Who shared a wife. Who shared a meal.

[SFX] chair falling as someone stands abruptly

[HEN|panicking] The meat... the meat, what was—

[SAM|soft] She was delicious, wasn't she? So tender. So sweet. Just as you all found her in life.

[MIC|retching] No... no...

[SAM|louder] She fed your lust, and now she's fed your gluttony! Perfect justice, wouldn't you say?

[THO|enraged] You're insane!

[SAM|shouting] I'M BETRAYED! By her! By all of you! My friends! My neighbors!

[ROB|horrified] You fed us your wife...

[SAM|quiet] Not all of her. There's more in the cellar. Enough for weeks. I preserved her, just as she preserved her beauty. Salt. Smoke. Time.

[NAR] The revelation hung in the air like the blade of a guillotine. Each man processed the horror differently: Michael vomited onto the floor, Henry began to pray frantically, William sat frozen in shock, Robert stared at his empty plate, and Thomas lunged for Samuel.

[SFX] chair crashing, struggle

[SAM|gritted] You enjoyed her, Thomas! All of you did! In life and now in death!

[SFX] knife scraping across table

[NAR] In the struggle, the knife skittered across the table. Robert grabbed it, his miller's hands steady despite his fear.

[ROB|clarity] Stop. Both of you.

[SFX] struggle ceasing

[ROB|firm] Is it true, Samuel? Did you kill Margaret?

[SAM|defiant] Yes. And I served her to you, as you deserved.

[MIC|quiet] Why would you tell us? Why not let us live in ignorance?

[SAM|sincere] Because I wanted you to know. I wanted you to live with it. Every day. Every meal. For the rest of your lives.

## SCENE:JUDGMENT

[NAR] Dawn found six men still around the table. The remnants of their meal had been cleared away. The fire had died to embers. Their faces were gray with shock, disgust, and the terrible weight of decision.

[WIL|hoarse] What do we do with him?

[THO|hollow] The law has no punishment for... for this.

[ROB|grim] Some crimes fall outside the law.

[HEN|desperate] We could say she ran off. People already think that.

[MIC|whisper] But we know. We would always know.

[SAM|calm] You can't undo what's been done. What's been consumed.

[THO|angry] Enough from you!

[SAM|unfazed] She's part of you now. All of you. Forever.

[WIL|cold] If this became known, we'd all be ruined. Ostracized. The town would never recover.

[ROB|nodding] Some secrets must remain buried.

[HEN|understanding] Like Margaret.

[MIC|realizing] And Samuel.

[SFX] tense silence

[NAR] The decision wasn't spoken aloud. It didn't need to be. It hung in the air between them, as real and solid as the table they sat around. Five men who had entered as individuals would leave as conspirators, bound by the unspeakable.

[SAM|afraid] Wait. What are you—

[THO|cutting] You wanted justice, Samuel? You'll have it.

[WIL|precise] Robert, the knife. Henry, bring the rope from the stable. Michael, dig in the cellar—there needs to be room for two.

[SAM|desperate] Please! I just wanted you to understand what you took from me!

[NAR] But understanding had come at too high a price. For Samuel. For all of them.

[SFX] struggle, door opening

[SAM|final] You'll taste her every time you eat! You'll remember every time you break bread! You'll never be free of this night! Never!

[SFX] door slamming

## SCENE:CONCLUSION

[NAR] The stable master's house stood empty by spring. Dust gathered on the long oak table where six men had shared their last meal together. The town spoke in hushed tones of the tragic lovers: Margaret who ran away, Samuel who chased after her, neither ever seen again.

[SFX] wind through empty house

[NAR] Five men kept their silence. Five men who never again shared a meal together. Five men who would push away their plates, suddenly without appetite, when certain memories surfaced.

[SFX] distant church bell

[NAR] In time, the story faded like all stories do. But in Willow Creek, an odd custom developed. No one quite remembered how it started. Something about refusing meat from a neighbor's table without first asking what it was and where it came from.

[SFX] knife cutting into meat

[NAR] Some customs, after all, are born of terrible wisdom.

[SFX] final sizzle of meat on fire, then silence
