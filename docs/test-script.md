# THE LIGHTHOUSE

## PREMISE
A short story about a lighthouse keeper named Edward who faces a terrible storm one night while harboring a dark secret about what really happened to his predecessor.

## SPEAKER NOTES

**CHARACTERS:**

**Edward Wells** - The current lighthouse keeper. Voice is mid-range with a slight gruffness. Speaks with deliberate pacing, often hesitating when discussing the past. Has a subtle coastal accent.

**Marion Wells** - Edward's wife. Warm, melodic voice with a soft-spoken delivery. Speaks with concern and occasional suspicion.

**Jonathan Pierce** - The previous lighthouse keeper (appearing in flashbacks). Deep, authoritative voice. Speaks with confidence that borders on arrogance.

**Captain Harris** - Coast Guard captain. Crisp, official tone. Military-like precision in speech with a commanding presence.

**Narrator** - Clear, engaging storyteller voice. Neither too dramatic nor too detached. Should build tension through subtle changes in pacing and tone.

**Special Audio Considerations:**
- Storm sounds should gradually intensify throughout the story
- The lighthouse foghorn should be a recurring audio motif
- Flashbacks should have subtle echo effect
- Edward's guilt-ridden thoughts should have whispered reverb
- The creaking of the lighthouse tower during the storm should increase with the narrative tension

## INTRODUCTION

[sound: distant foghorn, gentle waves]

**Narrator:** On the jagged coast of Maine, where the Atlantic hurls itself against unyielding rock, stands the Pemaquid Point Lighthouse. For over a century, its beam has guided ships safely through treacherous waters. But on this night, as storm clouds gather on the horizon, the light seems somehow dimmer, as if reluctant to push back the coming darkness.

[sound: door opening, wind gusting]

**Marion:** Edward? Edward, you should come inside. The weather service says this storm will be worse than expected.

**Edward:** (distracted) Just a few more minutes, Marion. I need to check the fuel levels again.

**Marion:** You checked them twice already today. (pause) It's the anniversary, isn't it? That's what's bothering you.

**Edward:** (tense) I don't know what you're talking about.

**Marion:** One year since Jonathan disappeared. One year since they gave you this post.

[sound: wind increasing]

**Edward:** (sharply) I earned this position. (softer) I'm sorry, I just... I need to make sure everything is perfect tonight. With this storm coming...

**Narrator:** Edward's eyes drifted to the churning sea below, to the exact spot where they'd found Jonathan Pierce's empty boat one year ago. No body was ever recovered.

**Edward:** *They trust me to keep the light. But if they knew what really happened that night... if Marion knew...*

[sound: foghorn blaring]

## RISING ACTION

**Narrator:** As darkness fell, the storm arrived with a fury that seemed almost personal. Rain lashed against the glass of the lantern room, while wind howled through every crack in the old tower.

[sound: intense rain, wind howling, structure creaking]

**Edward:** (to himself, checking equipment) Fuel level optimal, backup generator tested, radio... (static crackles) Radio operational.

[sound: radio static, then voice breaking through]

**Captain Harris:** (through radio) *bzzt*...Point Lighthouse, this is Coast Guard vessel Northern Star. Do you copy? Over.

**Edward:** This is Pemaquid Point, I copy. Over.

**Captain Harris:** We've got reports of a fishing vessel lost in your sector. Crew of three. Last known position approximately two miles southeast of your location. Visibility zero. They'll be looking for your light. It's all they've got. Over.

**Edward:** (tension in voice) Understood. I'll make sure the light stays strong. Over.

[sound: radio static, then silence]

**Narrator:** Edward felt the weight of responsibility press down upon him. Three lives now depended on his vigilance, on the steady beam of light pushing back against the storm. He climbed the spiral staircase to check the great lens once more.

[sound: footsteps on metal stairs, wind growing louder]

**Edward:** *Just like last year. Another storm. Another distress call. I can't let happen what happened to Jonathan...*

[sound: flashback transition, echo effect begins]

**Jonathan:** (arrogant) You worry too much, Wells. I've kept this light through worse storms than this.

**Edward:** (past) The backup generator is acting up again. If the main power goes—

**Jonathan:** (interrupting) Then we switch to the backup and fix the problem. Simple as that. I've been doing this job since before you were measuring weather patterns at community college.

**Edward:** (past, irritated) I have a meteorology degree from—

**Jonathan:** (dismissive) Fancy papers don't keep ships safe. Experience does. Now make yourself useful and go check the lower levels for leaks.

[sound: flashback transition, echo effect ends]

**Narrator:** The memory faded as Edward reached the lantern room. The massive Fresnel lens rotated steadily, sending its beam out into the tempest. But as Edward watched, the light flickered momentarily.

**Edward:** (alarmed) No, no, no...

[sound: electrical humming becoming irregular]

## CLIMAX

[sound: violent thunder crack, then electrical buzzing stops]

**Narrator:** The main power failed with a suddenness that left Edward in near-complete darkness. The emergency lights cast weak, red illumination across the equipment.

**Edward:** (urgent) Backup generator, where's the... 

[sound: fumbling, then switch flipped repeatedly]

**Edward:** (panicked) Come on! Start, damn you!

[sound: generator struggling to turn over, then failing]

**Narrator:** As the generator refused to engage, Edward's mind raced. The fishing vessel would be navigating blind. Without the lighthouse beam, they would likely be driven onto the rocks.

[sound: Marion's footsteps hurrying up stairs]

**Marion:** Edward! The power—

**Edward:** I know! The backup won't start!

**Marion:** What do we do?

**Edward:** (decisive) Get me every lantern and flashlight in the house. Every battery. Every candle. Now!

[sound: Marion hurrying back down stairs]

**Edward:** *Jonathan would know what to do. He always knew...*

[sound: flashback transition, echo effect begins]

**Jonathan:** (angry shouting) You're useless in a crisis, Wells! The generator's flooded because YOU didn't secure the housing properly!

**Edward:** (past, defensive) I checked it twice! The seal must have been damaged already—

**Jonathan:** (furious) Excuses! While you're making excuses, men could die out there!

[sound: physical struggle]

**Jonathan:** Get out of my way! I'll fix it myself!

**Edward:** (past) Be careful, the platform is slippery—

[sound: slip, then scream fading down]

**Edward:** (past, horrified) JONATHAN!

[sound: flashback transition, echo effect ends]

**Narrator:** Edward gasped as the memory released him. His hands trembled as Marion returned with an armful of lights.

**Marion:** (concerned) Edward? You're white as a ghost.

**Edward:** (shaken) I'm fine. Help me set these up around the lens.

[sound: arranging lights, storm still raging]

**Narrator:** They worked frantically, positioning every light source they had to amplify through the Fresnel lens. The result was weak—perhaps a quarter of the normal power—but it was something.

**Marion:** (after a moment) Will it be enough?

**Edward:** (grim) It has to be.

**Marion:** (hesitant) Edward... there's something I've wanted to ask you for a year now.

**Edward:** (tense) This isn't the time, Marion.

**Marion:** The night Jonathan disappeared... You were the last one to see him alive.

**Edward:** (defensive) I told the investigation everything. He went to check the exterior platform during the storm. It was reckless. He fell.

**Marion:** But you didn't see him fall? You just... found his flashlight on the platform?

**Edward:** (increasingly agitated) What are you suggesting?

**Marion:** Nothing. It's just... you changed after that night. And sometimes, when you're sleeping, you talk. You say his name.

[sound: radio crackling to life]

**Captain Harris:** (through static) Pemaquid Point, do you copy? The fishing vessel has made visual contact with your light. Weak but visible. They're adjusting course. Over.

**Edward:** (relieved) They can see us. They're going to make it.

[sound: sudden violent impact, glass breaking]

**Narrator:** A massive wave struck the lighthouse with such force that one of the lantern room windows shattered. Rain and wind whipped into the small space, extinguishing several of their makeshift lights.

**Marion:** (screaming) Edward!

[sound: more glass breaking, wind howling directly]

**Edward:** (shouting) Stay back from the windows!

**Narrator:** As Edward fought to protect the remaining lights, a particularly strong gust caught the broken window frame, tearing it completely free. The metal edge struck Edward's forehead, sending him stumbling backward.

[sound: impact, then Edward falling]

**Edward:** (dazed) Marion...

**Marion:** (frantic) You're bleeding! We need to get downstairs!

**Edward:** (weak but determined) No... the light... have to maintain the light...

**Marion:** Your head—

**Edward:** (suddenly seeing something outside) Wait... there!

[sound: faint engine noise barely audible through storm]

**Narrator:** Through the broken window, they could just make out running lights. The fishing vessel, pushing through monstrous waves, following the feeble beam from their makeshift array.

**Edward:** (urgent) We need to keep the light going just a little longer!

[sound: wooden beams creaking dangerously]

**Marion:** (frightened) Edward, the tower can't take much more of this!

**Edward:** (desperate) Just a few more minutes! They're almost past the rocks!

**Narrator:** As the lighthouse swayed precariously, Edward's eyes fixed on the small boat fighting its way along the safety corridor defined by their light. And in that moment, something broke inside him.

**Edward:** (confessing, voice breaking) I killed him, Marion.

**Marion:** (stunned) What?

**Edward:** Jonathan. We fought during the storm. He was berating me, like always. I just... I pushed him. I didn't mean for him to fall, but the railing was rusted, and... (breaking down) I watched him disappear into the waves.

[sound: tower creaking more intensely]

**Marion:** (processing) Edward...

**Edward:** (desperate) Now you know. I'm not fit to keep this light. I failed Jonathan, and now I'm failing those men out there.

**Marion:** (after a moment, firm) Look at me, Edward. (pause) Whatever happened with Jonathan is between you and your conscience. Right now, those fishermen need us. They need this light.

**Edward:** (broken) I can't...

**Marion:** (strong) You can. You must. This is your atonement.

## RESOLUTION

[sound: intense storm sounds begin to slightly diminish]

**Narrator:** For an hour more they fought to maintain their fragile beacon, replacing batteries as they died, relighting candles blown out by the wind. Gradually, the storm began to ease, having spent the worst of its fury.

[sound: radio crackling]

**Captain Harris:** Pemaquid Point, this is Northern Star. The fishing vessel "Second Chance" has reached safe harbor. Crew reports your light saved their lives. Whatever you did up there... well done. Over.

**Edward:** (emotional) Thank you, Captain. Over and out.

[sound: radio being set down]

**Narrator:** As dawn broke, Edward and Marion stood surveying the damage. The lighthouse had held, though it bore new scars from the night's battle. Edward turned to his wife, his face revealing both exhaustion and something else—perhaps the first tentative step toward redemption.

**Edward:** (quietly) What happens now?

**Marion:** (gentle but firm) Now you make a full statement to Captain Harris. Whatever the consequences.

**Edward:** (resigned) And us?

**Marion:** (after a pause) One day at a time, Edward. One day at a time.

[sound: foghorn in distance, gentler waves]

**Narrator:** The morning light revealed a coast transformed by the storm's passage. Debris littered the rocks below, and the sea continued its eternal assault on the shore. But the lighthouse remained, its purpose fulfilled once more. In the light of day, Edward Wells would face his past. But for now, he had kept the light—and in doing so, perhaps found his way back to the man he once was.

[sound: single foghorn blast, then silence]
